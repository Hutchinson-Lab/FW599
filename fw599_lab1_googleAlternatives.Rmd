Google maps has been giving me lots of errors when I try to download basemaps! It seems like this might be something with the licensing / data access within the google API? Following are some alternatives to google maps.

First, I'll prep the data, following what we did in Lab 0.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(knitr)
library(sp)
library(raster)

library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)

#set project directory
proj_dir <- "/Users/lilaleatherman/Documents/BoxSync/osu_classes_current/2018 fall/fw599_sdms/labs/lab0/"

data_dir <- "/Users/lilaleatherman/Documents/BoxSync/osu_classes_current/2018 fall/fw599_sdms/labs/data/"

```

Note, that I'm using data management commands from the packages tidyverse and magrittr. You may have heard of one of the data management packages contained within them: dplyr. 

```{r load and inspect data}

#load data
load(paste0(data_dir, "janDuckDataNAmer.RData")) #duckData
load(paste0(data_dir, "envStack.RData")) #envStack

#explore ebird data
#head(duckData)

#select my species
spp = "Melanitta_perspicillata" #aka Surf Scoter
spp_aka = "Surf Scoter"
spp_alpha = "MELPER" #alpha code

#spp = "Aix_sponsa"
sppCol = which(names(duckData) == spp) 
#class(duckData[,sppCol])

#str(duckData)

presAbsFact = duckData[,sppCol]!="0"
presAbsNum = as.numeric(presAbsFact)

# add presence / absence columns
# I think this makes it easier to use this variable as a factor in ggplot.
# This does not affect how the data are mapped, but it changes the commands you use to map them.
duckData %<>%
  mutate(presAbsFact = duckData[,sppCol]!="0",
         presAbsNum = as.numeric(presAbsFact))

```

Now, to take a look at the species records on a map. Google provides a way to access baselayers for plotting your points on a map. But, it can throw a lot of errors!

```{r plot species records on a map }

# map = get_map(location = c(min(duckData$LONGITUDE)-10,
#                            min(duckData$LATITUDE)-10,
#                            max(duckData$LONGITUDE)+10, 
#                            max(duckData$LATITUDE)+10),
#               maptype = "satellite")
# 
# p = ggmap(map)
# p + 
#   geom_point(duckData %>% arrange(presAbsNum),
#              mapping = aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, col = presAbsFact)) + 
#   labs(title = paste0(spp_aka, " presence vs absence in eBird data"))
```
And, as evidence of how finicky this can be-- the original map would not download when I attempted to render this document! Here is a .png of the map, for reference.

## Using alternate baselayer sources for maps

An easy way to get around the errors from google maps is just to change the source of the get_map() command. Because google is the default, we have to specify a different source.

### Stamen maps

[Stamen](http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/12/37.7706/-122.3782) is a data visualization utility provides a few different options for map baselayers-- that are easier to query than google. Similar to the google maps, you're also downloading map tiles from an online utility-- but the stamen maps tend to be less finicky and proprietary.

To use them, use the command get_map(), but set source to "stamen".

You can also read more about the different sources and maptypes in the [documentation for the ggmap package.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/ggmap.pdf) 

```{r mapping alternative to ggmap - stamen maps, message = FALSE}

#stamen - default
map = get_map(location = c(min(duckData$LONGITUDE)-10,
                           min(duckData$LATITUDE)-10,
                           max(duckData$LONGITUDE)+10, 
                           max(duckData$LATITUDE)+10),
              source = "stamen")

p = ggmap(map)
p + 
  geom_point(duckData %>% arrange(presAbsNum),
             mapping = aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, col = presAbsFact)) + 
  labs(title = paste0(spp_aka, " presence vs absence in eBird data"))

```

The default stamen map provides a terrain-esque baselayer-- with none of the warning messages we get from google. 

You can note that the range appears a little different from the google map-- we can see the gray outline of the base plotting environment on the left of the map. Try experimenting with different extents for the location to adjust this. 

Stamen also provides other basemaps that look a little different. You can specify these using the argument "maptype" in the get_map() command. Use the ?get_stamenmap command to see all possible maptypes.

Below, I show a couple different variations of Stamen map types.

```{r stamen - toner, message = FALSE}

#stamen - toner
map = get_map(location = c(min(duckData$LONGITUDE)-10,
                           min(duckData$LATITUDE)-10,
                           max(duckData$LONGITUDE)+10, 
                           max(duckData$LATITUDE)+10),
              maptype = "toner", source = "stamen")

p = ggmap(map)
p + 
  geom_point(duckData %>% arrange(presAbsNum),
             mapping = aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, col = presAbsFact)) + 
  labs(title = paste0(spp_aka, " presence vs absence in eBird data"))

```

```{r stamen - watercolor, message = FALSE}

#stamen - watercolor
map = get_map(location = c(min(duckData$LONGITUDE)-10,
                           min(duckData$LATITUDE)-10,
                           max(duckData$LONGITUDE)+10, 
                           max(duckData$LATITUDE)+10),
              maptype = "watercolor", source = "stamen")

p = ggmap(map)
p + 
  geom_point(duckData %>% arrange(presAbsNum),
             mapping = aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, col = presAbsFact)) + 
  labs(title = paste0(spp_aka, " presence vs absence in eBird data"))

```

This is, I think, the simplest way to update the code we're already working with to reliably produce attractive maps. However, I detail a couple additional methods below.

### Static maps: using ggplot and colorblind-friendly color schemes

ggplot2 can also be used to make maps, without the ggmap package. I like this because it allows you to plot points (and even polygons!) over a raster layer, and customize how your raster looks, in ways that I think are easier to understand than in base R (e.g., plot() ).. However, there are a few additional data processing steps here, so it's less well-suited for on-the-fly visualization. 

We're also using the [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) package for this rockin color scheme. Unlike other color schemes, which often rely on distinctions between green and red, viridis supplies a variety of color schemes that have gradations that are perceptible to folks who can't easily perceive the difference between green and red. 

This uses the gplot() (not ggplot()) command from the rasterVispackage, which is a wrapper around ggplot to use with raster data. A more detailed tutorial for plotting raster data in R is located [here](http://zevross.com/blog/2015/03/30/map-and-analyze-raster-data-in-r/).

This first method requires little data processing, but produces maps that sometimes look striated when I render them to export in markdown. (Not sure why! Something weird with the mapping?) 

Importantly, you'll notice that the spatial resolution of the basemap is only as good as the raster data that you're visualizing.

```{r static maps with geom tile, message = FALSE}

library(rasterVis)
library(viridis)

p = gplot(envStack[[1]]) +
  #geom_polygon(data = ks, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", size = 1) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = value)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(na.value = "white") + 
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

p + geom_point(duckData %>% arrange(presAbsNum),
             mapping = aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, col = presAbsFact), size = 1) + 
  labs(title = paste0(spp_aka, " presence vs absence in eBird data"))  
  

```

A mapmaking method that requires a little more data prep-- but generates smoother-looking maps on the fly-- is to convert your raster data set to a data frame of points, with a value for each lat-long combination in the data set. This is in contrast to a raster, which is essentially a matrix of data. Confusingly, the geom_raster() function cannot plot an actual raster! 

```{r static maps with geom raster}

#write function to convert raster to ggplot-friendly format
raster_to_pts_gg <- function(raster) {
  spdf <- as(raster, "SpatialPixelsDataFrame")
  df <- as.data.frame(spdf)
  colnames(df) <- c("value", "x", "y")
  df
}

#convert selected raster to list of points
envStack1_ras <- raster_to_pts_gg(envStack[[1]])

#plot
p = ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = envStack1_ras, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis() + 
  #remove default plotting background
  theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

p + 
  geom_point(duckData %>% arrange(presAbsNum),
             mapping = aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, col = presAbsFact), size = 1) + 
  labs(title = paste0(spp_aka, " presence vs absence in eBird data"))  


```

## Leaflet

Mapmaking capabilities in R aren't just limited to static maps-- there are a couple different utilities for making interactive maps in R. The widely-used mapping software [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) can be used in R.

I referred to [this useful demo](https://gbif-europe.github.io/nordic_oikos_2018_r/s3_gbif_demo/gbif_demo.html) for downloading gbif data in R, and then visualizing using leaflet.

First, we need to make sure that the appropriate packages are installed. [mapr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapr/index.html) has a simple leaflet mapping utility that we'll install. Conveniently, mapr can take data frames as an input. There is also [Leaflet R package](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

```{r leaflet in R via mapr }

library(mapr)

#commented out for rendering to pdf

# #map only presences
# 
# duckData %>%
#   #convert to long format, such that there is a row for each observation of each species.
#   #map_leaflet() needs the species name to be "name"
#   gather(key = "name", value = "occs", -c(SAMPLING_EVENT_ID:PRIMARY_CHECKLIST_FLAG, presAbsFact, presAbsNum)) %>%
#   #filter to just your species of interest
#   filter(name == spp) %>%
#   filter(occs != 0) %>%
#   mutate(latitude = LATITUDE,
#          longitude = LONGITUDE) %>%
#   select(name, longitude, latitude, occs, STATE_PROVINCE, COUNTY ) %>% #limiting the number of fields makes the map render faster. 
#   
#   map_leaflet(., "longitude", "latitude", size=2)

```

In the interactive map, you can zoom in and out, and mouse over / click on your occurrence points to see data about them. 

Because I was running into some time issues with how long it took to build the leaflet map, I've limited the data set pretty strongly here-- to only include points for my species of interest, where it has at least one observation, and just a few data fields.

Here's a [much more complex Leaflet tutorial](http://strimas.com/r/ebird-county/) that uses specifically eBird data, mapped in R using Leaflet. 

The full leaflet package provides a lot of options to customize your map baselayers, markers, and labels, which are detail in the Leaflet R package tutorial. Without getting too complicated, here's a very simple way to visualize your data in R

```{r leaflet in R via leaflet}
library(leaflet)

#commented out for rendering to pdf

# #filter data to only include presences
# #similarly, this takes a lot of time to render when we have this much data.
# duckData %>%
#   filter(presAbsNum != 0) %>%
#   leaflet() %>% 
#   addTiles() %>%
#   #simple, default markers where you set what shows when you mouse over ("label") and click on ("popup") a point.
#   addMarkers(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, popup = ~as.character(presAbsNum), label = ~paste0("Occurrences observed: ", as.character(presAbsNum)))

```
